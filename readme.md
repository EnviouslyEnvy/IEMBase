# Welcome to IEMBase!

A web app made to congregate a collective score on IEMs (In-Ear Monitors) based on individual reviewer scores, as well as display curated comments of the most complimentary and critical scorers.
This web app is not meant to replace visiting reviewers' databases, and only contains data on IEMs that have been given grades or scores by multiple reviewers, encouraging users to explore the reviewers' original lists and reviewers for further details, opinions, and to support them.

Currently deployed. Check it out [here](https://www.iemindex.com/)!

### Inspiration

Making purchase decision is a tough call to make in the hobby of IEMs, especially given the subjectivity of audio preferences, the potentially sky-high costs of the hobby, and the sheer volume of IEM releases at present. My goal was to make this arduous process of researching information on IEMs less difficult by giving a general idea of what to consider about each IEM model. To go about this, I chose to develop my frontend with ReactJS from scratch for the first time, while honing my skills in using Python's data libraries with a Flask backend that congregates and combine several reviewer opinions into one.

In the end, the aim of the app is to be give users a general but informative perspective of an IEM and how it stacks up against others, making navigating through this hobby just that bit easier for overthinkers like me.

### What did I learn?

- The fundamental structure and framework for creating frontends with ReactJS.
- Integrating the rigorous capabilities of Python's data tools and a SQL database with a backend framework with Flask.
- Debugging issues with frontend and backend deployment services (Vercel, Render.com)
- Utilizing RESTFul API endpoints with Flask and ReactJS
- Utilizing RESTful API endpoints with Flask and ReactJS

### What's next for IEMBase?

- Adding visuals to the IEMs using something like D3.js for even better interactivity and customization
- A visual on disparity between the highest score and lowest score.
- Adding sorting methods for the IEMs.
- Adding price data.
- Tracking the ratings of IEMs from brands over time, and predicting the ratings of future IEMs based on the brand's past releases using forecasting models or ML.
- Adding additional reviewer data.
- Adding a way to be sent to a squig.link.
- Smarter reviewer accreditation, add more hyperlinks.
